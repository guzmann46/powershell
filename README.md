# Remember
Most of its setting took affect globally in windows but few setting only affect the current user (like debloating, dark/light mode, startmenu tiles cleanup, deleting temp files etc), it's recommended to use it seperately on other local user account. <br /> <br />
After windows Feature update, most of the bloatware gets reinstalled and some of the setting get restored. To outcome this, use windows toolbox again.
